For our robot we decided to move forward using the raspberry pi 4 model B instead of the arduino
because of the slight improvements that come with it. Raspberry pi has more connectivity in which we
can use bluetooth. This allowed us to use a controller to control the robot. We decided on a playstation 
controller in which we could utilize the dpads and the other controls on the other side Triangle X O and 
Square. With this we were able to connect the dpads to control the arm movements and big movements. While
the Shape buttons we decided to use to more do small specific hand movements to properly get the angle to
grab objects. 
We were unable to get a hold of a better hand so we made special objects that our hand could grab.
